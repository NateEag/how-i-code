Here, I write about how I make software.

I do this for a few reasons:

  * Writing about how I make software forces me to think about how I make
    software. Thinking about how I make software will spur me on to write
    better software and to write it in better ways.

  * It helps me keep track of tools I use and ones I would like to use,
    particularly ones I have not found yet.

  * It gives me a place to point people where I have (hopefully) already
    explained why any particular aspect of my coding style exists.

  * By documenting how I write software, I may save someone else who writes
    software a painful life lesson I have already learned.

The project is meant to be published as a static website, after being compiled
with Pelican. I hope to eventually write a post-receive hook so that publishing
a new set of changes is just ``git push <remote>``.
