Here, I write about how I make software.

The project is published as a static website, compiled with Pelican.

Note that the dates on articles are currently mostly false. This is because
I do not display them, and it gives me a way to force the "frontpage" article
to be on top all the time. The default date is based on the filesystem, so
if I ever find another way to force the "main" article to the front page, that
would solve this problem handily.
