There is a never-ending torrent of technology and information screaming for
your attention, insisting that without it, you are an inferior developer,
incapable of doing anything of value.

It is not so.

Knowing Python's file APIs, understanding the vagaries of MySQL configuration,
grokking C's dereference operator - these are valuable skills, but they are not
essential to writing software. They apply only to certain tools.

A small set of fundamental skills, however, are useful in all software
projects, regardless of environment or tools. You need not be an expert in any
of these to make valuable contributions, but learning any of them will make you
much more effective. These are the essential skills in writing software, the
ones you should spend years mastering and refining:

* `Caring for users`_
* `Understanding problems deeply`_
* Listening
* Reading
* Writing
* Speaking
* Triage
* Learning from mistakes
* Experimenting
* Naming
* Data modeling
* Using programs
* Writing maintainable programs
* Changing programs
* Debugging programs
* Designing interfaces
* Designing algorithms
* Editing text
* Optimizing programs
