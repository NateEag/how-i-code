There is a never-ending torrent of technology and information screaming for
your attention, insisting that without it, you are an inferior developer,
incapable of creating value.

It is not so.

Knowing Python's file APIs, understanding the vagaries of MySQL configuration,
grokking C's dereference operator - these are valuable skills, but they are not
essential to writing software. They apply only to certain tools.

A small set of fundamental skills, however, are useful in all software
projects, regardless of environment or tools. You need not be an expert in any
of these to make valuable contributions, but learning any of them will make you
much more effective. These are the essential skills in writing software, the
ones you should spend years mastering and refining:

.. TODO Consider renaming 'Documenting programs ' to 'Explaining programs'?
   Writing is better than talking but both are helpful, and they're both higher
   up the list of fundamentals.

.. TODO Decide whether editing text is just a sub-point of writing.

.. TODO Decide whether 'Learning new tools' is a subpoint of 'Using programs'.
   I think it is not, but if I decide that I should explain why in the
   respective essays.

.. TODO Put link to https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/performance-matters/ in
   the not-yet-created essay on optimizing - you don't usually need to do it,
   but baseline UI lagginess can be a major problem. See also Knuth on
   optimization, Google's "performance is a feature", "measure before you
   optimize", etc., etc., etc...
