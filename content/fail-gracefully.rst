People make mistakes.

Every human endeavor shows this to be brutal truth, but it stands out starkly

Software, then, should embrace our failures, errors, mistakes, and regrets.
Rather than shackling us in safety, it should let us wander freely and help
us homeward when we find we have lost our way.
