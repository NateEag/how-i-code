Summaries And Descriptions
==========================

:summary: Summaries are short. Descriptions are long.

If an entity has a descriptive text field about a sentence long, call it `summary`.

If the entity has a longer descriptive text field, call it `description`.

git's treatment of commit messages can be described this way - the first line of
the message is the commit's `summary`, and the body is the commit's `description`.

It is astonishing how many systems use `short_description` and
`long_description`, or equally verbose, unclear names.

Don't do that.
