Know Your Editor
================

:summary: Musicians have instruments. Programmers have editors.

Most programming languages are written, read, and edited as plain text.

Therefore, a programmer should find a good text editor and master it.

There are many options, but the best ones are the
`venerable <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/>`__
`workhorses <http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/howtolearn.html>`__.

Emacs and vim have been honed over decades to a razor edge, each incarnating
generations of hard-won insight on how to change text. To learn that wisdom
takes time and patience, but the effort is well worth it.

Both are arbitrarily extensible [1]_ and have a huge array of extensions to
handle almost every editing task you can think of (and a few that you haven't).

If you change OSes, or `RMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman>`__
and `Moolenar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar>`__ die, Emacs and
vim will still be there. So will your configuration, extensions, and
workarounds (keep those under version control).

Closed-source editors won't last a lifetime, but these two are halfway there.

When you find an bug that impacts only you and two others, it need not languish
until the maintainer gets bored or goes broke and shuts down the project. Keep
the code around and fix it yourself.

.. [1] Few love `vimscript
       <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2011/09/writing-vim-plugins/#making-vimscript-palatable>`__,
       but Emacs Lisp illustrates an arcanely beautiful style of software
       development that has largely vanished since the death of the
       `Lisp machines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine>`__.
       It is an ugly Lisp, by most accounts, but an ugly Lisp
       `still beats most languages <http://paulgraham.com/avg.html>`__.
