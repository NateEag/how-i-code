Know Your Editor

:summary: Musicians have instruments. Programmers have editors.

All art forms have technique, which might be defined as "the mechanisms by
which the artist incarnates his vision."

A pianist's technique is how he presses the keys.

A painter's technique is how he puts paint on the canvas.

A programmer's technique is how he changes programs.

Good technique is not sufficient to make good things, but it is necessary. Most
programs are created, edited, and read as plain text, so a programmer should
find good tools for doing those things and master them.

.. This feels like it should be split into its own essay.

There are many options, but the best ones are the
`old <http://software-carpentry.org/v4/shell/>`__
`venerable <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/>`__
`workhorses <http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/howtolearn.html>`__.

Emacs, bash, and vim have been honed over decades to a razor edge, each
incarnating generations of hard-won insight on how to change text. To learn
that wisdom takes time and patience, but the effort is well worth it.

Both are arbitrarily extensible [1]_ and have a huge array of extensions to
handle almost every editing task you can think of (and a few that you haven't).

If you change OSes, or `RMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman>`__
and `Moolenar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar>`__ die, Emacs and
vim will still be there. So will your configuration, extensions, and
workarounds (keep those under version control).

Closed-source editors won't last a lifetime, but these two are halfway there.

When you find a bug that impacts only you and two others, it need not languish
until the maintainer gets bored or goes broke and shuts down the project. Keep
the code around and fix it yourself.

.. [1] Few love `vimscript
       <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2011/09/writing-vim-plugins/#making-vimscript-palatable>`__,
       but Emacs Lisp illustrates an arcane, beautiful style of software
       development that has largely vanished since the death of the
       `Lisp machines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine>`__.
       It is an ugly Lisp, by most accounts, but an ugly Lisp
       `still beats most languages <http://paulgraham.com/avg.html>`__.
