Know Your Editor
================

:summary: Musicians have instruments. Programmers have editors.

Most programming languages are written, read, and edited as plain text.

Therefore, a programmer should find a good text editor and master it.

There are many options, but the best ones are the
`venerable <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/>`__
`workhorses <http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/howtolearn.html>`__.

Emacs and vim have been honed over decades to a razor edge, each an incarnation
of generations of hard-won insight into manipulating text. To learn that wisdom
takes time and patience, but the effort is well worth it.

Both are arbitrarily extensible, with a huge array of existing extensions to
handle almost every editing task you can think of, and a few that you haven't.

If you change OSes, or `RMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman>`__
and `Moolenar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar>`__ die, Emacs and
vim will still be there. So will your configuration, extensions, and
workarounds (keep those under version control). Closed-source editors don't
last a lifetime, but these two already have.

When you find an obscure bug that impacts only you and two others, it need not
languish as "wontfix" until the maintainer gets bored or goes broke and shuts
down the project. Keep a clone of the code around, and you can roll up your
sleeves and fix it yourself.

Delving into Emacs Lisp exposes you to a style of software development that has
largely vanished since the death of the
`Lisp machines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine>`__. It is an ugly
Lisp, by most accounts, but an ugly Lisp
`still beats most languages <http://paulgraham.com/avg.html>`__.
