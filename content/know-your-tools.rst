Know Your Tools
===============

:summary: Musicians have instruments. Programmers have editors.

All art forms have technique, which might be defined as "the mechanisms by
which the artist incarnates his vision."

A pianist's technique is how he presses the keys.

A painter's technique is how he puts paint on the canvas.

A programmer's technique is how he changes programs.

Good technique is not sufficient to make good things, but it is necessary. Most
programs are created, edited, and read as plain text, so a programmer should
find good tools for doing those things and master them.

When you discover a new tool that may meet one of your needs, set aside a few
minutes to take a closer look and see if it's actually a good fit.

If closer review suggests it might be, take a little more time to give it a
trial run and see how it works for you. If it works well, consider adding it to
your personal toolbox.

When you add a tool to your personal toolbox (whether by choice or because
someone else wants you to use it), take some time to get to know it. Go through
the settings and options. Take half an hour to go through any documentation it
has, focused on seeing the big picture and what features, bugs, or quirks the
tool may have that you would otherwise learn the hard way.

.. TODO Split into its own essay, one which makes the case for
   preferring archaic, powerful, open tools by default.

There are many options, but the best ones are the
`old <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`__
`venerable <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/>`__
`workhorses <http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/howtolearn.html>`__.

Bash, vim, and Emacs have been honed over decades to a razor edge, each
incarnating generations of hard-won insight on how to work with text. Learning
that wisdom takes time and patience, but the effort is well worth it.

Both are arbitrarily extensible [1]_ and have a huge array of extensions to
handle almost every editing task you can think of (and a few that you haven't).

If you change OSes, or `RMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman>`__
and `Moolenar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar>`__ die, Emacs and
vim will still be there. So will your configuration, extensions, and
workarounds, if kept under version control.

Closed-source editors won't last a lifetime, but these two are halfway there.

.. [1] Few love `vimscript
       <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2011/09/writing-vim-plugins/#making-vimscript-palatable>`__,
       but Emacs Lisp retains a beautiful, arcane style of software
       development that has largely vanished since the death of the `Lisp
       machines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine>`__. It is an ugly
       Lisp, by most accounts, but an ugly Lisp `still beats most languages
       <http://paulgraham.com/avg.html>`__.
