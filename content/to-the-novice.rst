There is a never-ending torrent of technology and knowledge screaming for your
attention, insisting that without it, you are an inferior developer, incapable
of doing anything of value.

It is not so.

Knowing Python's file APIs, understanding the vagaries of MySQL's configuration
options, grokking C's dereference operator - these are valuable skills, but
they are not essential to writing software. They can be applied only when using
a particular tool.

A small set of fundamental skills, however, are useful in all software projects,
regardless of environment or tools. These are the essential skills in writing
software, the ones you should spend years mastering and refining:

* Caring for users
* Understanding problems deeply
* Writing
* Speaking
* Applying existing tools to problems
* Debugging
* Designing interfaces
* Data modeling
* Writing readable code
* Designing algorithms
* Optimizing programs

They are in approximately descending order of importance, but such a ranking
is not quite possible.
