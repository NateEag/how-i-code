There is a never-ending torrent of technology and knowledge screaming for your
attention, insisting that without it, you are an inferior developer, incapable
of doing anything of value.

It is not so.

These are the essential skills in writing software, the ones you should spend
years mastering and refining. They are sorted approximately in descending order
of importance, but they are interrelated, so that is not entirely possible.

* Caring for users
* Understanding problems deeply
* Writing
* Speaking
* Applying existing tools to problems
* Debugging
* Designing interfaces
* Data modeling
* Writing readable code
* Designing algorithms
* Optimizing programs
