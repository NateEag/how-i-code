There is a never-ending torrent of technology screaming for your attention,
insisting that if you do not know it, you are an inferior developer, incapable
of doing anything of value.

It is not so.

The essential skills in writing software, the ones you should spend years
mastering and refining no matter what you specialize in, are these:

* Caring for users
* Understanding problems deeply
* Mastering the written word
* Mastering the spoken word
* Solving problems with existing tools
* Designing interfaces
* Data modeling
* Writing readable code
* Designing algorithms
* Optimizing programs
