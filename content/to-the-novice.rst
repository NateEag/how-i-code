There is a never-ending torrent of technology screaming for your attention,
insisting that if you do not know it, you are an inferior developer, incapable
of doing anything of value.

It is not so.

These are the essential skills in writing software, the ones you should spend
years mastering and refining. They are sorted roughly from most important to

* Caring for users
* Understanding problems deeply
* Mastering the written word
* Mastering the spoken word
* Using existing tools to solve problems
* Debugging
* Designing interfaces
* Data modeling
* Writing readable code
* Designing algorithms
* Optimizing programs
