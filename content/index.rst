How I Code
==========

:slug: how-i-code

On this site, I maintain a set of documents outlining how I write software.

I do this for several reasons:

  * _Writing_ about how I make software forces me to _think_ about how I make
    software. Thinking about how I make software helps me write better
    software.

  * It helps me keep track of tools I like to use and tools I wish I had.

  * It serves as a way to explain the nuances of why I write software the way
    I do, so that other people can have a better understanding of my approach.
    Hopefully, others will glean something useful from my comments.
