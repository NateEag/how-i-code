How I Code

:summary: Why this site exists.

This is a set of essays about making software.

I write them for several reasons:

* It may be useful to others.

* It helps me understand the process of building software.

* It helps me turn mistakes into lessons learned.

* It helps me remember lessons I have learned.

* It helps me document the tools I use and how I use them.

* I must obey the inscrutable exhortations of my soul.

I write these essays as instructions to myself, so I use imperative voice for
rules I apply generally. I try to explain why any given instruction has general
rule status.

I hope you find them useful.
