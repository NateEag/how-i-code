:summary: Why this site exists.

This is a set of essays about making software.

I write them for several reasons:

* They may be useful to others.

* They help me improve at making software.

* They document what tools I use and how I use them.

* I must obey the inscrutable exhortations of my soul.

I hope you find them useful.
