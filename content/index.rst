How I Code
==========

:category: meta

This is a set of documents that outline how I make software.

I maintain these docs for several reasons:

* Others who read them may learn something useful.

* Thinking about how I make software makes my software better.

* It gives me a place to make note of tools I use.

* It gives me a place to make note of tools I want to use (especially ones
  I have not found yet).

* I must obey the inscrutable exhortations of my soul.

I hope you enjoy them.
