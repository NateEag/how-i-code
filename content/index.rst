How I Code
==========

:category: about

This is a set of notes on making software.

I maintain them for several reasons:

* They may be useful to others.

* They help me improve at making software.

* They let people see the tools I use and am interested in using.

* I must obey the inscrutable exhortations of my soul.

I hope you find them useful.
