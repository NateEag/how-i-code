Abbreviations

:summary: Abbreviations can make things clearer, but don't abuse them.


Short names can be more readable than long ones.

Abbreviations shorten names, and thus can help readability.

Too-short names, however, can be utterly unreadable. ``pbya`` is not a
readable name (I eventually figured out that it stood for Post BY Author).

The following is a list of abbreviations I believe strike a good balance
between brevity and readability. They should not usually be used by themselves
- they are useful building blocks when naming things.

alg
  "algorithm" - When choosing algorithms dynamically, this can come in handy.

btn
  "button" - handy in GUI programming.

cls
  "class" - For when you have a reference to an actual class, as opposed
  to an instance of a class. Used frequently in Python.

cmd
  "command" - useful when writing command-line programs.

cur
  "current" - useful when dealing with ordered data structures. See also prev
  and next.

dir
  "directory" - useful when doing filesystem manipulation.

opt
  "option" - useful when writing command-line programs, or dealing with user
  preferences. Sometimes used as a top-level dir in a \*nix-ish directory tree.

prev
  "previous" - pairs well with 'next' when dealing with ordered data
  structures.

para
  "paragraph" - useful when formatting text.

pos
  "position" - index in an ordered data structure. Clearer than the
  traditional 'idx'. Often a good suffix.
