Triaging Issues

When a program `surprises someone </software-surprises.html>`__, it represents
an issue the development team should respond to.

Triage is the act of turning issue reports into a plan of action to `take care
of the user's problem </caring-for-users.html>`__.

Every issue report from a program user should be put in an issue database for
that program, which serves as the formal incident record.

Even minor issues that are well-known and on the way to resolution should be
entered, because that gives you a way to determine how frequent and how common
an issue is, as well as a way to track all users who should be notified once the
issue is resolved.

Paired with human analysis of the issue's severity, that gives you exactly what
you need to prioritize development work.
