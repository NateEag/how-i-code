At work today I put the following in the #random channel.

=================================

Because I am a slow thinker, I only just realized that programming is
inherently and necessarily an act of introspection.

The program does what you want the first time perhaps one in a thousand
attempts.

Every other attempt, it does not do what you want.

You must therefore ponder what you told the computer to do and find the
flaw in your own understanding of what you wanted and what you said.

Introspection.

Perhaps that's the actual variable that controls whether people can do it -
whether they're psychologically capable of introspection and self-reflection.

================================

I'm not sure where this belongs - it seems at least tangentially related to one
of the fundamental skills.

The uncertain hypothesis is precisely that it is *the* fundamental skill -
being able to consider your mental state and ideas independently from your
identity and seek out their flaws.

If you can do that, you can debug.

If you cannot, you cannot debug.

Not sure it's quite true, but there's the germ of a good idea there, I think.
