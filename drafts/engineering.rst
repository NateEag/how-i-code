I am not a software engineer.

They clearly exist (NASA has a lot of them), but I've never worked with one.

Engineering is crucial when lives are at stake, but it's overkill for most
software.

Do not confuse "engineering" with "applying basic rigor." They are not the same
thing, and most software developers do neither.

I put a few thoughts about this on HN:

Note that this question ties closely to the "quality is finite" essay -
engineering is applying a high level of rigor to get really high quality on
several specific axes, reliability and robustness being two of the big ones.
Efficiency is another value FAMANGs tend to apply the engineering approach to.
