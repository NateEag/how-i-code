My understanding of technical debt has matured over the years, due largely to:

.. TODO Link the quality is finite essay once it exists.

1) My own realization that quality is finite,

2) Reading an article (which I have lost the link to) that pointed out
   technical debt is always a human problem. No one sat down and said "Let me
   write a bunch of crappy code on purpose", so before you try to fix it, you
   need to understand the human and organizational factors that brought it
   about in the first place.

Anyway, my goal at present is not to write an essay on technical debt.

I just want to save a link to a good article that pertains to technical debt,
even if indirectly:

Specifically, it talks about "normalization of deviance".

It's one thing to have technical debt, or to take it on intentionally - it's
another entirely to insist that you don't have any when you actually have lots.
