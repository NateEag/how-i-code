Managing people is not a requisite skill for a programmer. It certainly makes
things easier if you can, though.

It is a requisite skill for a team lead, though, which is something I have done
a few times now.

And I have Thoughts on it.

A quick copy/paste from a discussion with Austin Lawrence:

==================================

Management's job is to enable and empower the people who do understand the job
to do it.

That necessarily means worrying less about understanding it yourself, and
trusting them to get the details right.

At least if you're managing well.

If you are not managing well, you dive into every last detail and micro-manage
everyone into insanity, despair, or quitting.

You do have to check in regularly to see if actual progress is being made, and
understand why not if it isn't.

That way you can get them what they need to get unwedged.

And you CANNOT rely on someone else to actually evaluate if progress is
happening. You have to look at their output yourself.

Not the nuts and bolts, but use the software, try to break it, keep close tabs
on the spec.

Be sure it's improving, not worsening, and that new features are getting done.

Does that all make sense?

Good managers are freaking rare, but they do exist.

What they actually manage is human relationships.

The team members' relationships with each other, and the team's overall
relationship with the rest of the company.
