I should write a real outline of how you do this.

For the moment I just want to remind myself that every feature you ever build,
part of your workflow should be taking a minute at the start to ask "Is this
actually a good idea?" and "Is this the next best thing I can do for this
project?"

Otherwise you will spend intelligence and effort on something stupid.

well, you still will do that, because you'll be wrong a lot.

But you can cut down the amount you spend without *too* much effort.
