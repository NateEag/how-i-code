Note from an email to myself:

Vagrant is the current tool of choice, but at core, theyâ€™re the perfect way to let you test automation of sysadmin tasks.

And also of being able to reliably reproduce a dev environment.

Chef or Puppet might be a purer way to make it work, but a sudo shell script is good enough for getting something working. You can always scale up to a better tool later.
