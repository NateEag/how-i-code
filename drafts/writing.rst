When a programmer makes tools for other people, she has to communicate with
them.

.. TODO Hyperlink 'read' to the not-yet-extant essay on reading.

Writing is a powerful tool for doing so. It creates a durable, accessible
record of thought. Even those who cannot read can still experience it, by way
of text-to-speech software or a human reader.

.. TODO Hyperlink 'Speaking' and 'listening' to their respective essays.

Speaking and listening are crucial skills for a programmer, but they apply
mainly in face-to-face conversations, which are not always practicable, and
tend to drift off-topic.

What attributes make writing useful to a programmer?

Text is searchable. Images, audio, and video must be manually sorted through,
sifting for the ideas the viewer seeks, but with a digital text,
half-remembered ideas are only a quick search away.

Text is random-access. It's simple, especially with hypertext and a table of
contents, to quickly find the part you want, even without prior knowledge of
the document.

Text is `archiveable`_. If printed on good paper and stored carefully, it will
long outlive the program it describes. Indeed, the best way to preserve a
program for centuries is probably printing out its source code and storing it
(along with a copy of `Knuth`_).

Text is referenceable. People can remember or record where a particular idea is
written and refer other people to it. This is a crucial attribute for technical
communications, and is at the heart of formal documentation and specifications.

Text is durable. If a writer wants specific people to understand his ideas, he
can write them down and distribute them in a document. Recipients need not
disrupt their schedule to read the document, nor must the author bend his
schedule to the listeners' whims.

.. This is a controversial opinion. It may be wrong.
.. TODO Decide whether I really believe this, and publish or remove accordingly.
..
.. Because of these benefits, prefer written communication by default.

What are writing's weak points?

People only engage when they feel `cared for`_, and interacting solely via text
rarely achieves that.

For the same reason, face-to-face conversation is best when discussing
emotionally charged topics. It is much harder to read moods and reactions in
text, and text makes it much easier to disguise those things.

Writing is hard with those who cannot or will not read. American literacy is
poor enough that such people are extremely common - literacy is the rare
exception, not the rule.

If knowledge exists only in one person's head, writing is an excellent way to
capture it, as it is then available for anyone to absorb. However, if someone
needs the knowledge quickly, waiting for a good document to be written may take
too long. In such cases, have a conversation for speed's sake, but make an
audio recording of it.

The next time someone needs the information, the audio can be transcribed, and
from there slowly massaged into a clear, well-structured written document.

.. This should link to the idea of lazy-loading quality, as that's exactly what
   it is - lazy-loading documentation.

.. TODO This is probably its own essay, actually - something about honesty?
   Transparency? Maybe two essays, actually - part of this belongs on the
   data-preservation essay, and part is about transparency.

On software projects, prefer writing in public to private, and digital media to
static ones. Private communications, like email, can only ever benefit the
people they are sent directly to, but a `wiki`_ page can be useful to anyone in
the company (and beyond, if the wiki is public). Finding information in a
binder full of printed documentation can take hours, but searching the same
documents on a hard drive can be done in seconds.

However, you should print a copy if you want it to `last`_.
