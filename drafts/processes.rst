Formalized workflows and processes eliminate certain kinds of mistakes at
the cost of flexibility.

Be careful about introducing them.

A process for humans should make it easier to do the right thing than the wrong
thing.

It is an error to define a human process where the wrong thing is impossible.

If it is possible to prevent all errors in the process and that goal appears to
have a positive return on investment, then the process should be automated and
executed by machines.

It is also a great idea to include an expiry condition on processes for humans,
an idea I learned from this essay:

.. This one needs some time to sit and stew, obviously.
