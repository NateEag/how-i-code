Formalized workflows and processes eliminate certain types of mistakes at
the cost of flexibility.

Be careful about introducing them.

The goal of a process for humans should be to make it easier to do the right
thing than the wrong thing.

It is an error to try to make a human process in which it is impossible to do
the wrong thing. If preventing all errors is conceptually possible and valuable
enough to be achieved, then the process should be one for machines and
therefore automated.

.. This one needs some time to sit and stew, obviously.
