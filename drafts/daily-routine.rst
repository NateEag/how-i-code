Daily Routine
=============

An attempt to define my daily workflow as a programmer.


Start Of Day
------------

Process email inbox

Process RSS notifications (mostly useful for tracking software releases)

Update/install Emacs packages (twenty-minute limit)

Define goals for day

Publish goals for day (can wait for standups when applicable)


Goal-Achievement routine
------------------------

Break goal into tasks

For each task:

Estimate completion time

If estimate > 1 hour, break into smaller tasks, enqueue them, and break loop

Set timer for estimated time

Attempt to complete task

If timer goes before completion, reconsider approach. Update task list if
necessary.

If task proves to be ill-conceived, reconsider task breakdown and goal
selection in context of whole project. Add, change, and remove tasks and goals
as appropriate based on discoveries.


Scheduled Events
----------------

Check email before going to lunch (or after if lunch comes as a surprise)

Check email an hour before signing off (so you have time to act on anything important)

Do not check it unprompted otherwise.


Interrupt Handling
------------------

People take priority over goals except in emergencies (TODO define business
emergency. Goals where failure to achieve them in time will immediately damage
the company's ability to remain solvent?). Therefore, encourage interrupts by
humans via IM, face-to-face/video conversations, and phone calls (sigh).

After any work-related conversation:

Prune notifications ruthlessly. Their purpose is to trigger your interrupt
handler.
