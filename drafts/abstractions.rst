Abstractions are helpful, but only as a means to an end.

Is that true? I just typed it on opening this file. Not sure where it came
from.

Anyway, I opened this file to make note of [Hyrum's
Law](http://www.hyrumslaw.com/), which strikes me as essentially true:

    With a sufficient number of users of an API,
    it does not matter what you promise in the contract:
    all observable behaviors of your system
    will be depended on by somebody.

It relates mildly to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and its
useful-but-wrong belief that you can use an API's version number to communicate
whether a new version is drop-in compatible with the one you're currently
using.
