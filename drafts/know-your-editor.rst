Know Your Editor
================

[Just a small rant on how your editor is your instrument, your brush, your
vehicle, the thing by which everything is done.

Every time you touch the mouse, or repeat a series of actions manually, you are
failing your duties as a programmer. You should ruthlessly automate your
workflow, and your editor should help you.]
