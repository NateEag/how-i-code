Deployment is the process of getting a program installed and configured on
each computer that needs it.

Doing that also requires installing all dependencies - programs it depends on,
libraries it depends on, and configuration to make it behave correctly on the
target machine.

https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software has a ton of very good info
about this process.
