I'm flirting with the idea of UI-first development, at least for SPAs.

Putting a UI that lets them actually work in front of Real Users is generally
a useful, powerful thing.

When writing a single-page app, a decent DB mocking library and HTTP service
mocking library could be paired to let you hardcode test data and hammer out UI
drafts.
