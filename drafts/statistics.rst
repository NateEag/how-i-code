Statistical analysis is incredibly useful in software.

In retrospect, I really wish I had learned more stats while I was in college.

Specifically, I wish someone had taught me how to apply them to understand the
behavior of programs in aggregate.

I did the standard calc-based course and did okay, but I never really got great
at it.

Alas, I'm not good enough at it to write intelligently on the subject (or even
use it the way I wish I could).

A few links that may be worth linking to themselves, though, for future
reference:

application of statistics, as opposed to the academic learning of it.

angry rant from Zed Shaw about stats, how useful they are, and how programmers
ignore them.
