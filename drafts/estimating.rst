I'm pretty bad at estimating how long a task will take.

So are most developers.

There are good reasons why that is, which much brighter people than I have
written about at length. I might eventually link some of those, but I probably
won't try to explain it myself.

I'm therefore interested in how you can work with schedules and timelines in a
way that's actually useful for informing business plans.

Joel has a venerable old piece of advice I've never gotten to try but which
sounds plausible to me:

This dude I don't know from Adam also has some interesting thoughts:

In both cases, it boils down to "Use historical completion time data to forecast
a range of probable outcomes, with relatively low-grained estimates."
