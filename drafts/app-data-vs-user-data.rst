Application Data And User Data
==============================

Application data belongs in source control, and can be modified at the
development team's whim.

User data is created by a non-developer, and the dev's job is to protect it
with his life.

well, at least his code's life.

[I was explaining what belongs in version control to Sherri today, and realized
that this was, quite literally, the distinction.]
