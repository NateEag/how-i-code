Sometimes I stumble across algorithms I don't want to forget.

For instance, I've been annoyed before that I didn't have a good one for
selecting N random elements from a collection without duplication. It turns out
there *is* a good algorithm for this, published by Jeffrey Scott Vitter in
1987, in an ACM journal under the title "An Efficient Algorithm for Sequential
Random Sampling". More about it here:
