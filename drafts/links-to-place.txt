Here's a place to stack links whose appropriate home I don't know yet:

http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2019/11/10/scale/ - a wonderful story of how
autoscaling can bite you in the butt.

https://www.jefftk.com/p/shared-cache-is-going-away - caches are no longer
shared across domains as that turns out to be a security leak, so there's no
longer any point to pulling files from a third-party JS CDN (if there ever was
at all).

I should read through The Programmer's Stone and see if parts of it are
relevant for linking: http://programmersstone.com/
