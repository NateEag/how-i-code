Here's a place to stack links whose appropriate home I don't know yet:

I'm a firm believer that many things don't need a computer at all.
https://calmtech.com has a nice articulation of that concept (and seems to
roughly align with my instincts about how technology should work [though I like
having details more than they do, I think, usually available by drilling down
past the core status signals]). This one probably deserves its own essay.

http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2019/11/10/scale/ - a wonderful story of how
autoscaling can bite you in the butt.

https://www.jefftk.com/p/shared-cache-is-going-away - caches are no longer
shared across domains as that turns out to be a security leak, so there's no
longer any point to pulling files from a third-party JS CDN (if there ever was
at all).

I should read through The Programmer's Stone and see if parts of it are
relevant for linking: http://programmersstone.com/

In the "how to do a specific technical job" category, here's a nice overview of
how to monitor MySQL/MariaDB queries in progress:

The fact that I don't know where to put the query tracking link suggests that
maybe I need a 'Trivia' section where I just keep specific knowledge of
technical things I want to remember? Might sort of pollute the spirit of the
site, not sure. Flip side is, the site is fundamentally about how I program,
and looking up technical trivia instead of memorizing it is a big part of that.
