I'm not sure what I want to say about security exactly.

I do know that it is deeply linked to Quinn Norton's glorious, terrible rant
[Everything Is
Broken](https://medium.com/message/everything-is-broken-81e5f33a24e1).

I suppose Steve Yegge's observation that security is less important than
Accessibility, and that they're fundamentally at odds, is also relevant:

Not all attackers are sufficiently skilled or motivated, so you don't have to
be perfect to survive. There is always a risk and you cannot eliminate it, no
matter how brilliant you are.

You should still try, though, so an inquisitive thirteen-year-old doesn't end
your business without even meaning to.
