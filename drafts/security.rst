I'm not sure what I want to say about security exactly.

I do know that it is deeply linked to Quinn Norton's glorious, terrible rant
[Everything Is
Broken](https://medium.com/message/everything-is-broken-81e5f33a24e1).

I suppose Steve Yegge's observation that security is less important than
Accessibility, and that they're fundamentally at odds, is also relevant:

Offense is massively easier than defense. Defense against state-level actors
requires perfection (probably organized crime, too), and humans are not
perfect.

Not all attackers are sufficiently skilled or motivated, though, so you don't
have to be perfect to survive. There is always a risk and you cannot eliminate
it, no matter how brilliant you are.

The "outrun the hobbit, not the dragon" maxim applies, of course. Most
criminals and hackers are just looking for money, and low-hanging fruit is
always a better bet.

You should still try, though, so an inquisitive thirteen-year-old doesn't end
your business by accident.
