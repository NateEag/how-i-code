I am annoyed at emoji's presence in Unicode.

I think putting them there was a brilliant sociological hack to get Unicode
universally supported, but it still bothers the purist in me.

Conceptually, Unicode was about defining the characters used in all human
languages for written communication. Emoji are not characters and have no
business being in there, IMO.

In a Hacker News comment, I tried to define emoji, which I felt clarified why I
don't like them being there: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21690540

As a hedge against HN disappearing, here is the comment:
