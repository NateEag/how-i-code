I recently told someone I would spend some time thinking through which skills
are most valuable for getting hired as an entry-level web developer.

Here I am doing that.

I think the core skill for an entry-level developer is being able to turn
specifications into working code.

You can make a case that it's actually taking an existing spec

I suppose that's really two skills, in terms of my fundamentals list:

* Reading
* Adding features

Following that, I would say the next useful skill is bug fixing. In some ways
fixing bugs is more important than adding features, but maintainers do in fact
do both.

Finally, if you have some dexterity with version control (specifically Git and
Subversion), that will probably make it much easier to get hired.

Writing pairs naturally with reading. It's not as necessary, as you don't need
to be great at it for a lot of junior dev sorts of tasks, while most of the
time you'll be reading documentation, specs, bug reports, and the like while
finding your way as a junior dev.

It's still probably more important than version control, though, as you can
learn it on the fly.

...all that said, though, I think that realistically, no one is likely to check
reading or writing that closely. They're crucial skills, but interviewers on
average don't *realize* they're crucial skills, I suspect. See previous
discussion.

So, that leaves me at:

* Reading

* Adding features

* Fixing bugs

* Version control

* Writing
