:summary: Meetings are a double-edged sword - use them wisely.

.. TODO Split this into two essays? It's a bit dense and ill-structured at the
   moment.


When run and planned well, a meeting can yield great outcomes for those not
present. It can even have great outcomes for the attendees.

When not run or planned well, a meeting can make life miserable for both
attendees and those impacted by the meeting's outcome.

There are two types of good meetings: relational and planning.

Relational meetings are to help people relate well to each other,
while planning meetings focus on figuring out what to do next.

The most common relational meeting is often not recognized as such - it's a
one-on-one between an employee and a manager. A one-on-one is a chance for a
manager and an employee to touch base and to be reminded that they're both
humans, to see how they're relating to each other and to the rest of the teams,
and to surface any issues that may be distressing one of them.

Some example issues that could be distressing the employee, the manager, or
both:

* the employee may be upset that a coworker is micro-managing him
* the manager may be worried that the employee is going to quit
* the manager may be aware of layoff rumors
* the employee may be angry that a deadline is too tight

If relational meetings are spent primarily on such issues, then there are bigger
systemic issues, and those issues need to be dealt with.

There are other relational meetings, usually relevant when a team is not
gelling well. The oft-reviled "teambuilding exercises" are intended to help
teams relate well to each other (though an informal team lunch is probably a
better tool for that).

Most relational meetings should be recurring, because human relationships are
not static. Weekly is probably about right for one-on-ones.

When a relational meeting has not been done on a regular basis, the next one
that occurs is likely to fail in one of two ways:

* one party will refuse to bring up whatever may be bothering them, as the
  other party's failure to meet regularly communicates a lack of care, or
* the meeting will devolve into a tense, high-stress conflict, as the anger and hurt lurking
  beneath the surface come boiling out.

Relational meetings are crucial for keeping teams functioning well, but as that
suggests, they're meta-meetings - they're about making sure the team is
cohesive, functional, and able to focus on their tasks.

The planning meeting helps a team choose its tasks.

.. TODO Hyperlink to shared task tracker once I've got an essay on it.

Members of a healthy team are empowered to make decisions and choose actions on
their own, so they usually do just that. They keep each other apprised of their
plans and actions by creating and updating tasks in a shared task tracker as
needed. Any team member can thus see the exact state of any task by just
looking at it, and can offer feedback when and where it's needed, without
demanding another team member stop what they're focused on to talk to them.

This approach completely eliminates the status update as a meeting type -
anyone who wants to know the status just goes and looks at peoples' tasks.

Thus, most of the time, a healthy team does not use meetings to make plans and
act on them.

Sometimes a team member will find herself faced with a decision she believes
requires discussion with other team members.

When that happens, she begins preparing for a planning meeting.

The first step in that is writing a pair of documents: the meeting agenda and
the meeting memo.

.. TODO Decide whether a meeting should have more than one decision. Having a
   bunch of decisions means opportunities for derailment and distraction.
   Having one decision per meeting should enable pretty clear focus.

The meeting agenda is a list of decisions to be made. For each decision, the
organizer must include:

* the list of known options
* their recommended choice
* a summary of why they aren't moving forward with their recommendation
* the list of teammates whose input they want in making the decision
* the reasons they want those teammates' input.

If there are no decisions to be made, then there is no agenda, and without an
agenda, there is no meeting. Team members are incentivized to skip meetings
without agendas.

The meeting memo provides the detailed background information for each
decision. Think of it as providing the detailed version of each of the caveats,
with any context needed to understand those caveats.
