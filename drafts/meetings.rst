:summary: Meetings are a double-edged sword - use them wisely.

.. TODO Split this into two essays? It's a bit dense and ill-structured at the
   moment.


When run and planned well, a meeting can yield great outcomes for those not
present. It can even have great outcomes for the attendees.

When not run or planned well, a meeting can make life miserable for both
attendees and those impacted by the meeting's outcome.

.. TODO Rename these as "relational meetings" and "decisive meetings". They're
   shorter names, and I think clearer definitions of what their purpose is.

There are two types of good meetings: relational health checks and action
generators.

Relational health checks are meetings to see how some people are relating to
each other, while action generators focus on figuring out what to do next.

The most common relational health check is often not recognized as such - it's
a one-on-one between an employee and a manager. A one-on-one is a chance for a
manager and an employee to touch base and to be reminded that they're both
humans, to see how they're relating to each other and to the rest of the teams,
and to surface any issues that may be distressing one of them.

Some example issues that could be distressing the employee, the manager, or
both:

* the employee may be upset that a coworker is micro-managing him
* the manager may be worried that the employee is going to quit
* the manager may be aware of layoff rumors
* the employee may be angry that a deadline is too tight

If relational meetings are spent predominantly focused on such issues, then
there are bigger systemic issues, and those issues need to be dealt with.

There are other relational health checks, usually relevant when a team is not
gelling well.

Relational health checks should be scheduled on a regular basis. Weekly is
probably about right for one-on-ones. When a relational health check has not
been done on a regular basis, the next one on one that occurs is likely to fail
in one of two ways:

either one party will refuse to bring up whatever may be bothering them, as the
other party's failure to meet regularly communicates a lack of care, or the
meeting will devolve into a tense, high-stress conflict, as the anger and hurt
lurking beneath the surface come boiling out.

Relational health checks are crucial for keeping teams functioning well, but as
that suggests, they're meta-meetings - they're about making sure the team is
cohesive, functional, and able to focus on their tasks. The action generator is
a meeting to help a team choose its tasks.

.. TODO Hyperlink to shared task tracker once I've got an essay on it.

Members of a healthy team are empowered to make decisions and choose actions on
their own, so they usually do just that. They keep each other apprised of their
plans and actions by creating and updating tasks in a shared task tracker as
needed. Any team member can thus see the exact state of any task by just
looking at it, and can offer feedback when and where it's needed, without
demanding another team member stop what they're focused on to talk to them.

This approach completely eliminates the status update as a meeting type -
anyone who wants to know the status just goes and looks at peoples' tasks.

Thus, most of the time, a healthy team does not use meetings to make plans and
act on them.

Sometimes a team member will find herself faced with a decision she believes
requires discussion with other team members.

When that happens, she begins preparing for an action generation meeting.

The first step in that is writing a pair of documents: the meeting agenda and
the meeting memo.

.. TODO Decide whether a meeting is allowed to have more than one decision.
   Having a bunch of decisions means opportunities for derailment and
   distraction. Having one decision per meeting should enable pretty clear
   focus.

The meeting agenda is a list of decisions to be made. For each decision, the
organizer must include their recommendation, the caveats explaining why they
aren't simply moving forward with their recommendation, and the list of
stakeholders whose input is needed to make the decision.

The meeting memo provides the in-depth context required to have a clear
understanding of what each decision's

If there are no decisions to be made, then there is no agenda, and without an
agenda there is no meeting.

Each decision along with the meeting organizer's recommended decision
for each one.
