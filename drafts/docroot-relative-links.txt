How To Use Local Links
======================

There

docroot-relative links are by far the best thing to use.

If the site expects to be installed at a subpath, then it should offer an “app_path” config value, which is used as part of the prefix for such links.

I’ll have to figure out how to communicate this idea more clearly later.

...after a few more years of experience, I understand that the situation is not
quite this simple. Pure relative links are really useful for building a working
hunk of frontend code for which installation is just "put this directory
somewhere and include this JS file."
