Hiring
======

Finding good team members is brutally difficult.

The goal is simple, but the devil and all his minions are in the details.

A good team is comprised of people who can achieve the tasks set before them
and like working with each other.

Finding that set of people is what's so hard.

An idea that might help, which I have not tested but believe is promising:

Have an open “interview desk” with the rest of the team.

For the technical portion of an interview, give the candidate an existing
low-priority ticket to work on. Ask them to talk to people and ask questions,
then leave them to their own devices for an hour. Maybe two.
