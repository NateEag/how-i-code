I was trying to fix Angular's built-in form validation issues, and stumbled
across this:

Pretty good analysis of when to do which type of form validations (as-you-type,
after-you-type, etc)

As you might guess, the answer is "It depends."

Rule of thumb: If they know the answer (name, SSN, etc), validate on blur, and
probably don't bother giving them "Yay!" cues like checkmarks.

If they don't (username, password, etc), validate as they type, and give them
"Yay!" cues [maybe with a brief message explaining the 'yay'?].
