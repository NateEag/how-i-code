People make mistakes.

We see it in every human endeavor, but it stands out starkly in software, where
months of work can be annihilated in moments.

This is especially true for programmers, who demand power and flexibility from
their tools, rather than conservative safety.

To keep commands like 'rm -rf' from irretrievably ruining our projects, we use
`version control`_.
