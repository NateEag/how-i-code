Version Control
===============

People make mistakes.

We see it in every human endeavor, but it stands out starkly in software, where
months of work can be annihilated in moments.

This is especially true for programmers, who demand power and flexibility from
their tools, rather than conservative safety.

To keep commands like 'rm -rf' from irretrievably ruining our projects, we use
`version control`_.

TODO Explain somewhere that a commit summary should always start with 'Add'
(new feature, usually new UI associated), 'Remove' (take away feature or UI, an
important thing to do whenever possible), 'Fix' (change program behavior to
match intended behavior), 'Optimize' (make something run faster), 'Refactor'
(improve internal implementation without changing perceivable behavior),
'Explain' (write documentation). These are all related to the fundamental skill
'Changing programs', because these are precisely the kinds of changes you can
make to a program.
