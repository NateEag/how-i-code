2013-02-28 An overall article "Why" might be a good plan. I could expand on my
minimalist summary of why I write software from my website.

2013-02-28 An article on indentation (category 'formatting') would be good. Why
it matters, why use spaces, why nesting level matters (and thus why to wrap at
80 chars).

2013-11-12 The "Fail Gracefully" article needs to explain what is meant by
failing gracefully. Running it past Stephanie as a test made it clear that it
is not clear.

2013-03-13 Based on a conversation with Jim... A commit should do at least one
of two things: 1) improve the project's UI, or 2) make the programmers' lives
easier.

2013-03-14 Inspired by the above, I should probably do a set of articles on
version control. Why I need it, what it's for, what I use and how I use it.

2013-03-27 It might be madness, but when signing a user up for a
timezone-sensitive app, we can probably use JS to default the selected timezone
to something near them.

2013-03-27 Reconcile my approach to validation with translation and value/field
label substitutions for error messages. Remember that 'required' is not a
validation.

2013-03-27 Explain why interfaces should only publicize things that *have* to
be publicized. design, code as UI.

2014-01-11 Split the code review article into two articles. One goes in meta,
about human reliability (we always make mistakes), and serves as a touchstone
for that idea in this website (probably the "Fail Gracefully" article). The
other is actually a workflow article, on how to do code review.

2014-01-11 Consider extracting the comment on "usability testing" from the code
review article to its own article. Tricky because I have so little experience
of actual usability testing. That might be related to part of the hypotheticals
rant.
